# BLTools cracked
this took me 2 mins to reverse it. there wasn't even an antidebugger file or any list against Debuggers.

## Introduction
this Tool called "BLTools" is for some type of interaction with multiple platforms meaning cracking frmo what i assume. it has something to do with account checking.
its pretty much **NOT LEGAL**

## Why
why did i do this you may think?
I currently am learning on how to reverse engeneer many different executables files and i want to learn on how to correctly execute these things. I am not learning reverse engeneering for the bad purpose but to simply know what to do when i get suspicious files
btw. there were no Antidebugger files whatsoever. I used dnspy for the process

the above reason is probably only reasoning. Also I want to share my "success"
